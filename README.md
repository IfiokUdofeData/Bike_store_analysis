# INTRODUCTION
In this project, we are going to do a sales analysis using the data from a bike store company. 
The analysis is going to give you an idea of what to expect when facing a real world problem. We are making an asumption that we have been given access to the database of the company, which is obviously impossible. But we can go around that by creating the database on our local machine...
All the file and guide that you need is included in this repository, so feel free to explore as you like

# PROBLEM SOLVING STEPS
1.	Defining the problem (As done above)
2.	Get the dataset (In our case, we are getting it from our Bikestore database

6.  Analyzing the data in Excel

# GETTING DATA 
1. Open SQL server, create a new database and name it BikeStores 
2. Select the new BikeStores database in the SQL server 
3. Make sure that you have the `schema` folder on your local computer. The folder contains three sql files, which you will be using to create a database in your local computer
4. Open the 'create objects' query file and then execute it in the SQL server for the BikeStores database 
5. Open the 'load data' query file and then execute it in the SQL server for the BikeStores database

Once you have gotten to this point, then you are set to go on to your analysis. Every other thing will be done in the query file
